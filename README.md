I followed most of the homework, accept I thought Bamazon should be more like Amazon.  If a customer orders more then what's in stock, they'll be alerted to how many are backordered.  Further orders are prevented.  Included are examples of each interface:

node bamazonCustomer.js:

User first selects product:

They see a detailed description, and they chose how many quanitities of the item they want:

If they don't enter a number, they'll be prompted to try again:

If I buy 10 books of Girl in the Spider's Web for presents, the total price is shown, along with stock quantity change.  The prompt then goes back to the main menu:

Proof of products database changing:
